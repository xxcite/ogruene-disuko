# DISUKO – focuses on consuming SBOMs and the resulting actions based on their assessment.

DISUKO is an open-source project under the umbrella of the [Eclipse Foundation](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.disuko).  
It provides a modular and lightweight base to quickly start working with **Disuko** functionalities.  
The goal is to deliver a ready-to-run entry point with minimal setup effort.

## Quickstart

Run the following command in the project root directory:

```bash
cd disuko
./setup-dev.sh   # Windows: setup-dev.ps1
```

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

Check if all containers are running:

```bash
docker-compose ps --format "{{.Service}} {{.State}}"
```

### Open in browser

[https://localhost:3009/](https://localhost:3009/)

### Credentials

```
Username: CUSTOMER1
Password: CUSTOMER1
```
```
Username: CUSTOMER2
Password: CUSTOMER2
```

### Troubleshooting

- If something goes wrong (e.g., login issues), try logging out first:  
  [Logout User](https://localhost:3009/api/v1/oauth/logout)

- For the setup wizard, if an owner or company name is required, you may use "dummy" as value.

## SBOM Support

DISUKO supports uploading Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) after successfully creating a project.  
Before uploading an SBOM, you must first upload an SBOM schema under **Admin** with the label `common standard`.

The official SPDX schema can be downloaded here:  
[SPDX 2.3 Schema (JSON)](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/blob/support/2.3/schemas/spdx-schema.json)

---

## Next Steps

- Integrate your own configurations and data sources
- Enable additional modules and extensions
- Experiment with SBOM uploads for project transparency and compliance
